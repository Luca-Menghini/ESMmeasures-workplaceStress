## Notes: 

- The first part of the `S1_powerAnalysis_code.Rmd` generates three datasets (`TDS_PARAMETERS.RData`, `TCS_PARAMETERS.RData`, and `MDMQ_PARAMETERS.RData`) necessary to execute the commmands of the second part, which were too large to be shared but can be generated with the first part of the script (otherwise obtained upon request to the first author).
